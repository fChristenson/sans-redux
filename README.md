# Sans Redux

## What we will cover

* How we can migrate from Redux
* Why we would want to
* Why we would not want to

## Notes

Redux as many of you know is the default choice for adding the 
Flux architecture to a React application for most in frontend.

However something worth thinking about is if we really need it?

Redux will provide certain performance improvements and a range
of other features that may be needed in your project but are you
sure you need all of it?

With the addition of the context API React has given us much of
the core value Redux has been giving us this far and with just a
bit of boilerplate code we can cut out a dependency and tie our
code closer to the official API's instead of a external library.

If we want to be sure that our code will stay supported this is
a good way to do it.
